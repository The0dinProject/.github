# The0dinProject

## Overview

The0dinProject is a GitHub organization dedicated to the development and enhancement of **0din**, a decentralized, federated file hosting platform. Our primary focus is building, maintaining, and evolving 0din along with any supporting tools, libraries, and related technologies that help drive the project forward. We aim to foster a community of contributors who share our vision of a decentralized, scalable, and accessible file-sharing ecosystem.

## Our Mission

The0dinProject exists to support the continuous development of 0din and its related components. Our mission is to provide a fully decentralized solution for hosting, sharing, and accessing files that is easy to use, flexible, and resilient. We believe in leveraging the power of decentralization and federation to create systems that empower users, enhance privacy, and resist censorship.

## Core Values

1. **Decentralization First**: We are committed to maintaining the decentralized nature of 0din, ensuring that no central points of control or failure exist within the network.
  
2. **Federated Architecture**: Our focus on federation allows 0din to scale while giving node operators full control over their own environments, promoting diversity within the network.
  
3. **Community-Driven Development**: We encourage open collaboration. Contributions from developers, administrators, and users help shape the future of 0din.
  
4. **Simplicity and Usability**: Our goal is to make 0din easy to set up and manage, even for those with limited technical knowledge, while offering powerful features for advanced users.
